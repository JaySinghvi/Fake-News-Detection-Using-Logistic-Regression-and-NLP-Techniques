# Fake-News-Detection-Using-Logistic-Regression-and-NLP-Techniques
1. Constructed a predictive model to classify news articles as real or fake, leveraging logistic regression for effective binary classification.
2. Transformed textual data into numerical feature vectors using the TF-IDF vectorization method, which improved the model's ability to process and analyze text effectively.
3. Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values, merging relevant columns, and applying text preprocessing techniques such as stemming and stopword removal to ensure high-quality input data.
4. Utilized Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to preprocess and analyze text data, ensuring the model's capability to effectively distinguish between real and fake news articles.
