This project involved building a logistic regression model to classify news articles as real or fake, utilizing TF-IDF vectorization to convert textual data into numerical features for better analysis. Extensive data preprocessing was conducted, including handling missing values, merging relevant columns, and applying stemming and stopword removal to enhance input quality. Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were employed to refine text analysis, ensuring the model could accurately detect deceptive content. These combined efforts resulted in a highly effective fake news detection system.
